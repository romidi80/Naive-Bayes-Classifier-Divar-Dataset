Using Na√Øve Bayes algorithm for predicting labels on divar dataset.

This project revolves around the objective of constructing a classifier algorithm employing the Naive Bayes classification method. The primary aim is to facilitate the prediction of a new product's category by analyzing its characteristics and title keywords, drawing parallels with established classes and categories.

The project workflow unfolds in several stages. Initially, the datasets undergo normalization, enhancing their uniformity and consistency. Subsequently, the normalized data is segregated into distinct data frames, differentiating between the training and testing datasets.

Following the normalization process and the simplification of features, the core of the implementation lies in formulating the Naive Bayes probability mechanism. This pivotal step involves calculating the likelihood of a given data point belonging to a specific class. This probability computation is instrumental in predicting the class to which a particular data entry from the test data frame is likely to belong.

Towards the culmination of the project, the predictive capabilities of the Naive Bayes classifier are assessed. By analyzing the categories assigned to the test data entries, the efficiency and accuracy of the classification model are determined. This assessment provides insight into the model's performance and its ability to accurately predict categories for new products.

In essence, the project encompasses the construction of a classification predictor using Naive Bayes methodology. It involves data normalization, division into training and testing sets, probability calculation for classification, and evaluation of the predictive model's accuracy and effectiveness based on the test data outcomes.
